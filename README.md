# wiiu-account-settings
Modification (not remake) of the original account settings web applet for Wii U, designed in mind for Pretendo (for fun)

Made changes to Nintendos original JS and CSS, mostly recoloring the UI to purple, and changing the code for vanilla JS instead of jQuery, and added more stuff to control forms.
